void grabCut(InputArray img, InputOutputArray mask, Rect rect, InputOutputArray bgdModel, InputOutputArray fgdModel, int iterCount, int mode=GC_EVAL )

Parameters:
img – Input 8-bit 3-channel image.
mask –
Input/output 8-bit single-channel mask. The mask is initialized by the function when mode is set to
GC_INIT_WITH_RECT. Its elements may have one of following values:

GC_BGD defines an obvious background pixels.
GC_FGD defines an obvious foreground (object) pixel.
GC_PR_BGD defines a possible background pixel.
GC_PR_FGD defines a possible foreground pixel.
rect – ROI containing a segmented object. The pixels outside of the ROI are marked as “obvious background”. The parameter is only used when mode==GC_INIT_WITH_RECT .
bgdModel – Temporary array for the background model. Do not modify it while you are processing the same image.
fgdModel – Temporary arrays for the foreground model. Do not modify it while you are processing the same image.
iterCount – Number of iterations the algorithm should make before returning the result. Note that the result can be refined with further calls with mode==GC_INIT_WITH_MASK or mode==GC_EVAL .
mode –
Operation mode that could be one of the following:

GC_INIT_WITH_RECT The function initializes the state and the mask using the provided rectangle. After that it runs iterCount iterations of the algorithm.
GC_INIT_WITH_MASK The function initializes the state using the provided mask. Note that GC_INIT_WITH_RECT and GC_INIT_WITH_MASK can be combined. Then, all the pixels outside of the ROI are automatically initialized with GC_BGD .
GC_EVAL The value means that the algorithm should just resume.
